# Controls and settings

**English** | [简体中文](controls.zh-CN.md)

## Mac keyboard

| Action | Key |
| --- | --- |
| Move / camera | W A S D / I J K L |
| A / B / X / Y | X / Z / R / F (X confirms, Z goes back) |
| D-pad | Arrow keys |
| L / R, ZL / ZR | Q / E, Shift / Space |
| Inventory (+) / map (−) | Return / Tab |
| Left / right stick click | C / V |
| Control panel / performance overlay | ⌘, / ⌘P |
| Full screen | ⌃⌘F |

## Xbox controller

Xbox controllers connect automatically over Bluetooth or USB while the game window is in front. Menu (≡) is +, View is −. When the stick is deflected it takes priority over held keyboard keys. Rumble uses a curve calibrated for Xbox controllers.

## Control panel

Open it with ⌘, or **View → Controls**. Settings are saved to `work/settings.json` (override the path with `ZELDA_SETTINGS`).

The game language follows the system's preferred languages (Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch or Russian; otherwise US English). To pick another one, quit the game and add `"language"` to `work/settings.json` with one of `ja`, `en-US`, `en-GB`, `fr`, `fr-CA`, `de`, `it`, `es`, `es-419`, `nl`, `ru`, `ko`, `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`.

| Setting | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame rate | 30 / 60 / 90 FPS | Default 60. A target is not a guarantee; pre-rendered movies still play at 30 |
| Resolution | Original / 1080 / 720 / 640 | **Original** keeps the game's own dynamic resolution. Fixed modes render the scene at 1920×1080, 1280×720 or 1136×640 |
| MetalFX | Off / Window / 4K | Spatially upscales only the final image: **Window** to the window's pixel size, **4K** to 3840×2160 and then fitted to the window. Both apply only when the window has more pixels than the game image |
| Fullscreen, Sound, Performance | Off / On | Performance shows the overlay |
| Rumble | Off / On | Off stops rumble immediately; turning it back on does not replay old pulses. **Test** only checks the host output |

Older settings files are migrated automatically: `896p`/`balanced` become Original, `performance` becomes 720, the removed `480p` becomes 640, an old MetalFX On becomes Window, and old rumble strengths read as On. Unknown fields are kept.

## Startup screen

Until the game can draw without stalling, a startup screen covers the window with one progress bar that only moves forward. It shows the current stage: checking the shader libraries, compiling the ones that are missing (a long step on the first launch), starting the game, then loading the shaders and building the pipelines recorded on earlier runs. Stages with a counter show it, for example `Building pipelines 4,000 / 8,452`. The screen fades into the game when the warm-up ends.

## Performance overlay

The overlay (⌘P) shows FPS and target, render size, CPU, GPU time and memory. Its top-right corner shows the shader warm-up state: `Checking shaders`, `Shaders N%`, `Pipelines N%`, `Warming up` while the total is not yet known, and `Compiling shaders` when a new library or pipeline is created during play. The percentage refers to the current stage only.

## iPad

Without a hardware controller, the system touch controller is shown; + and − at the top open the matching menus. The overlay shows FPS and target, render size, app CPU, GPU time and physical memory; tap its top edge to collapse it. Auto-lock is suspended while the game is in front. Settings live in the app's `Documents/work/settings.json`, separate from the Mac; there is no full settings panel on iOS yet.
